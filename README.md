# SPOT 3 Bug Tracking

- 3.1a: Occasionally on first startup the pucks alternate between their on/off state. Hit "STOP" float; start the float again and the bug should be gone.The previous experiment diagram is still running but the user 
          either started a new experiment, or tried to turn on the pucks.

- 3.1b: Very rarely, the PhaseSpace cameras will fail to get a lock on the
       LEDs. Hit the emergency stop and reset the experiment.
