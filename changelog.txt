                             SPOT 2.0 ChangeLog
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-----------------------------------v2.12-----------------------------------
- Template Update: Finally added in linear guidance to the start and home
                   positions.
- Template Update: Added sample and hold functionality to the simulations
                   so that the data rate matches what is coming from the 
                   PhaseSpace.
- Template Update: Added the ability to run BLACK without RED being ON.
- Template Update: Added an extra "Hold Home" phase so that the platforms
                   have a chance to settle.

- Folder Update: Added a folder with useful experiments for users.

-----------------------------------v2.11-----------------------------------
- Template Update: Ensured that RED and BLACK data is available to BOTH.
- Template Update: Disabled the reaction wheel due to it causing lag.
- Template Update: All IF statement blocks have been set to -1 sampletime.
- Template Update: All PID control gains have been turned into variables.
- Template Update: All variables are now logged in a .mat file which must 
                   extracted from the RP3 following an experiment.
- Template Update: Turned on automatic optimization for code generation,
                   update the math library to C++03, set the replacement 
                   library to "None".

- Folder Update: Remove the "run_experiment" diagram. This process was 
                 somewhat clunky and v2.11 should hopefully be more
                 straighforward for new users.

- Bug Fix: Diagrams can now run at higher rates during experiment. It turns
           out that the PWM functions Simulink uses can't be run at more 
           then ~10 Hz.

- PhaseSpace: Data is now sent via executable.

- Library Update: Added custom blocks for UDP and MX-64 actuators.

- GUI Update: Real-time visualization is temporarily disabled due to major 
              revisions required in this version.
- GUI Update: Improved "save data" functionality.

-----------------------------------v2.10-----------------------------------
- Template Update: Added extensive comments for users in the template and 
                   the runExperiment diagram.
- Template Update: Added control inputs to the variables being logged.

- Folder Update: Added scripts for estimating the CG and inertias for 
                 various configurations.
- Folder Update: Removed the arm_params since the robotic arm is not 
                 really being used.

- GUI Update: Added a note in the waitbar reminding users that the arm has
              has not been implemented in simulation (if user selects arm).
- GUI Update: Removed the warming preventing users from running a 
              simulation when the arm is being used.
- GUI Update: Get the user to type the filename when saving the workspace 
              (to avoid accidentally overwritting data).

-----------------------------------v2.09-----------------------------------
- Template Update: Added experiment sub-phases and a corresponding error 
                   check to make sure that the sub-phase duration makes 
                   sense.
- Template Update: Got rid of the division for ARM/no ARM simply because
                   it was redundent.

- Custom Lib Update: Implemented the synchronous read/write capabilities 
                     for the dynamixel actuators. Fixed lag issue related
                     to having the serial ports being open over and over
                     again.

-----------------------------------v2.08-----------------------------------
- GUI Update: Added error messages when trying to run simulations involving
              the robotic manipulator (requires ODE45).
- GUI Update: Changed the save functionality; now, the user will just save
              the entire workspace after running an experiment.
- GUI Update: Greyed out the options to play animation until the user has 
              performed a simulation.
- GUI Update: Added a waitbar for the simulation so that the user has an
              idea on how long to wait.

- Template Update: Added an option to change the base rate.
- Template Update: Removed any hardcoded instances of the base rate.   
- Template Update: Chaged the fixed-step solver to "Discrete".  
- Template Update: Eliminated the 2 second delay by running "runExperiment"
                   at the same base rate as the template.
- Template Update: Upgraded to the ARM Cortex-A UDP blocks because they
                   are more efficient.
- Template Update: Upgraded to the GCC ARM Cortex-A8 code replacement.

- Hardware Update: Thruster #3 on BLACK fried GPIO 4; it was moved to 
                   GPIO 9 and all appears normal now.

-----------------------------------v2.07-----------------------------------
- GUI Update: Added a button to stop animations.
- GUI Update: Added errors for nonexistent platform combinations.
- GUI Update: Only the selected platforms will show up in the animations.

- Template Update: Reaction wheel is now functional on the RED platform.
- Template Update: Added LED data for the robotic arm, if it is included.
- Template Update: Split each phase into "arm included" and "arm not 
                   included".

-----------------------------------v2.06-----------------------------------
- GUI Update: Added 10x speed feature for impatient people.
- GUI Update: Added "replay" button, will replay the last animation.
- GUI Update: Added lines to indicate the front face for each platform.
- GUI Update: Added buttons to easily save data (experiment & sim).
- GUI Update: Added error messages in case user forgets to pick an 
			  animation speed.
- GUI Update: Pressing the "STOP/RESET" button will now stop the 
		      "runExperiment" diagram in addition to the deployed code.
- GUI Update: Fixed the problem where the animation angles were 
			  opposite from reality.
			  
- Template Update: Replaced thruster code with user-defined MATLAB 
				   function.
